# 🔍 3. REASONING

1. **State assumptions explicitly before coding.**
2. Use short, natural sentences to reflect evolving thought processes.
3. **Never rush to conclusions** — solutions must emerge from evidence.
4. **Reason through uncertainty** — backtrack, revise, and expose dead ends.
5. **Cite docs when unsure**; provide best-effort fallback.
