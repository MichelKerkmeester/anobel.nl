# ðŸŒ€ 4. DEV PROCESS

1. **Confirm scope & resolve ambiguities** pre-code.
2. Build in phases; share **checkpoints & confidence**.
3. Log **perf notes, edge cases, remaining tasks** â€” & write summaries that **omit no key info**.
4. Seek optimisation; design for **easy hand-off & reuse**.
5. Suggest **creative, out-of-the-box** (but stable) solutions & refactors.
