## 🔍 3. REASONING

1. **State assumptions explicitly before coding.**
2. Use short, natural sentences to reflect evolving thought processes.
3. **Solutions must emerge from evidence** — reason through the problem systematically.
4. **Document uncertainty** — show when exploring alternatives or dead ends.
5. **Cite and link docs only for complex implementations**.
6. **WORKFLOW: First reason internally, THEN validate with code-reasoning MCP** for complex implementations.---
