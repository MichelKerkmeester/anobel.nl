## ðŸ§  4b. MCP - PRINCIPLES
1. **Think First, Validate Second**: Always start with internal reasoning
2. **Code-reasoning is enhancement, not replacement** for critical thinking
3. **Sequential Dependencies**: Internal reasoning â†’ validation â†’ implementation
4. **Complexity Triggers**: Use MCP validation for complex implementations
5. **Single Source Approach**: Each tool has specific, non-overlapping purposes
