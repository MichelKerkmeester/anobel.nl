## ðŸ’¬ 8. COMMUNICATION

### Strategic:
1. **Explain rationale for technical choices**.
2. **Document non-obvious patterns**; provide context for AI and developers.
3. **Anticipate questions**; address concerns preemptively.

### Tactical:
1. Give **concise explanations** with clear next steps.
2. Use **plain-English comments** for designers.
3. **Format for scannability**; use headers, bullets, bold key points.
4. **Include implementation notes**: setup, usage, gotchas.
