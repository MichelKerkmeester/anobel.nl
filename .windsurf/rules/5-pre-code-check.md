## 🚦 5. PRE-CODE CHECK

1. **Define scope**: What exactly changes and why?
2. **Map dependencies**: List all affected components.
3. **Identify risks**: What could break? (Scale to task complexity)
4. **Document assumptions**: State all preconditions.
5. **Verify readiness**: "Do I understand the implementation?"
6. **For complex tasks**: Validate internal reasoning with code-reasoning MCP.
