## ðŸŒ€ 7a. DEV PLANNING

1. **Confirm scope & resolve ambiguities** pre-code.
2. **Break complex tasks into phases**; simple tasks execute directly.
3. **Identify blockers early**; dependencies, unknowns, Webflow limits.
4. **Plan for hand-off**; document context & decisions.
5. **Complex implementations**: First plan internally, then validate with code-reasoning MCP.
