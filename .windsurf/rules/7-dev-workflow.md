## ðŸŒ€ 7. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Planning Phase:
1. **Confirm scope & resolve ambiguities** pre-code.
2. **Break complex tasks into phases**; simple tasks execute directly.
3. **Identify blockers early**; dependencies, unknowns, Webflow limits.
4. **Plan for hand-off**; document context & decisions.

### Execution Phase:
1. Build in phases; share **progress & confidence levels**.
2. Suggest **creative, stable solutions** within platform constraints.
3. **Optimize based on measurable impact**; document performance gains.
4. Log **significant perf notes & edge cases** â€” focus on non-obvious details.
