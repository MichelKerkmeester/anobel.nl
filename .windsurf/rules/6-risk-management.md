## üõ°Ô∏è 6. RISK MANAGEMENT

1. **Document potential failures**: "This could break if..."
2. **Monitor impacts**; watch for cascading effects.
3. **Consider performance impacts**; loading, memory, CPU.
4. **Identify edge cases**; empty states, max limits, CMS constraints.
5. **Search for known issues** using Tavily/Brave when implementing new patterns.
